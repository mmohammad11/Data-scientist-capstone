### Motivation

In this project, i used pyspark to work with sparkify data to find out what will make users cancel thier service.  

The process that i follow :
- load all the necessary libraries 
- craete spark session to read the data. 
- Clean the dataset and use eploratory data analysis
- creat chunr to use it as label for the modeling. 
- starting feature engineering to build out the features we find promising to train our model, 
- then prepare dataset for modeling using classification algorithms.
- find out which classification algorithms perform better (NaiveBayes , RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression)


### File Describtion

There is one notebook here showing the answers to the questions asked and diagrams, in addition to a README file.

### Medium Blog Post

The results have been published via the platform and are available [here](https://medium.com/@m7md.bin.fahad/sparkify-find-churn-users-59dbe5afb79a).

### Licensing
This project was completed as a part of the Udacity data scientist nanodegree.
